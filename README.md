# Abstract

Currently, interest in the theory of nonlinear internal waves due to the need to develop more effective methods for describing the evolution of natural systems. Due to the increasing damage caused by catastrophic natural events such as storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, and study the dynamics of the formation of large waves and eddies become particularly relevant. One of the challenges is to find indicators of large-amplitude waves. Internal waves are the "markers" that indicate the earthquake and tsunami in the ocean and atmosphere. Problems of construction of analytical and numerical models more adequate theory of internal waves is largely due to the complexity of the basic equations. Anisotropy and dispersion of internal waves to distinguish them from the main class of wave motions (sound or light waves).

Methods of integral transformations using the methods of perturbation theory construct an exact solution of the problem of 3D periodic internal waves in a viscous continuously stratified fluid taking into account the effects of diffusion. The source of the waves is part of the sloping plane in the form of a rectangle or a disk, which can oscilate in any direction (along the plane or across). In the general case in a viscous fluid there are two types of solutions: regular (waves) and singular (called boundary layers). The solution for regular part (waves) in the limiting case transforms to the solution for the homogeneous fluid. The first one is a singular components has an analogue in a homogeneous fluid that is a periodic or Stokes' flow. Its thickness is defined by a universal micro scale depending on kinematics viscosity coefficient and a buoyancy frequency and by a factor depending on the wave slope. Another one a singular component, are a specific feature of stratified flows. Its thickness are defined the diffusion coefficient, kinematic viscosity and additional factor defining by geometry of the problem. We are constructed  solutions  for  the velocity, density, vorticity, pressure, and to force  (force  acting on the  source)  and energy  (energy density  and  energy)  flow characteristics  for different types of  wave sources.  Also  compared the  effectiveness of various  sources of the waves,  the most  effective source of  power  is  bipiston  type.

Numerical model for the analysis of the nonlinear problem is based on an analytical solution. The algorithm is based on the numerical scheme developed in [[1](http://mzg.ipmnet.ru/ru/Issues.php?y=2007&n=2&p=119)]. The calculations were performed on supercomputer [MSU "Lomonosov"](http://parallel.ru/cluster/lomonosov.html) is used on the open-source software [OpenFOAM](http://www.openfoam.org/). The analysis of the influence of viscosity stratification, the source size on the field radiated by internal waves. The results are compared with experimental data and analytical solutions.
